Discover Github Action

Target Application
Complete pipeline workflow for testing and delivering your software application.

We are going to use different useful tools to build your application, test it automatically, and check the code quality at the same time.

Setup GitHub Actions
The first tool we are going to use is GitHub Actions. GitHub Actions is an online service that allows you to build pipelines to test your application. Keep in mind that GitHub Actions is not the only one on the market to build integration pipelines.

Historically many companies were using Jenkins (and still a lot continue to do it), it is way less accessible than GitHub Actions but much more configurable. You will also hear about Gitlab CI and Bitbucket Pipelines during your work life.
